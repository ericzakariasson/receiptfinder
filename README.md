# Receipt Finder

## TODO

- [ ] If no attachments, print to PDF and send to Drive
- [ ] Custom instructions for receipts
- [ ] Add invoices
- [ ] How to handle links to invoices

- [ ] Also create spreadsheet with all the data? Then link to the receipt. Also a good case to attach metadata. Can be used to determine if there was an attachment or not, or if the user needs to go into certain platform to get the data.

### Metadata

- [ ] Date
- [ ] Amount
- [ ] Vendor
- [ ] Category
- [ ] Comment
- [ ] Receipt type (invoice, receipt, etc.)
- [ ] Needs manual review? (no attachment in file)
